1. JS Intro:
Js is a client side scripting language.
It is a programming language.
It is a case sensitive language.
It is used to create calculator, form validaiton, browser cookie store, enable-disable right click on browser etc.
It provides a security on browser.

Js fast load data on web browser.
Js is debugging in console which is inside inspect.

Two ways to call Js:
i) Internal (inside html page)
ii) External (create extra file and link to html)
Extension of JS file is .js


2. JS Operator:
i)    Arithmatic operator       :     +, -, *, /, %
ii)   Assignment operaotor      :     =, ==, ===
iii)  Comparision operstor      :     >, <, >=, <=
iv)   Logical operaotr          :     &&, ||
v)    Ternary operaotr          :     ?:
vi)   Shorthand operator        :     +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
vii)  Concatenator operaotr     :     + (This plus is not for addition of numbers)


3. JS Variable:
Variables is like container in which we can store information about any data.
Three types of variables in js:
i) var 
ii) let
iii) const

Difference between var, let & const:
var: It is globle scoped variable.
let : It is block scoped variable.
const : No changing after declaration.


4. Js Datatype:
Data type is an value which is stored inside a variable.
There are many types of datatype:
i)    Integer : let a = 10;
ii)   String  : let b = "JavaScript";
iii)  Float   : let c = 102.829;
iv)   Boolean : let d = true/false;
v)    Object  : let e = { Name:"Nikunj",
                          Course:"WD",
                          Age:23  };
vi)   BigInt  : let f = 12828283n;


Extra info:
typeof() : It is used to check the datatype of variable.
           ex. let z = "parth";
           console.log(typeof(z)); 
           Result will be - string.

window.location:'url to redirect';
upper syntax is used to redirect to other url.
