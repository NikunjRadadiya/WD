<!-- There are two ways to call function in js
1) Function call by value
2) Funciton call bt reference -->

<!-- 1) -->
<!-- <script>
  function test(name) {
    var name;
    return name;
  }
  document.write(test("Nik"));
</script> -->
<!-- By this the value of nik is stored inside the test -->



<!-- 2) -->
<script>
  let a = "Thia is me nik";
  let b = "This is p";
  b = a;

  console.log(a);
  console.log(b);

</script>
<!-- Both value will be same because of b = a , due to this we can call variable a by variable b -->
